# Potato-Power-Eurorack-USB-Power
A 5V USB to +/- 12V Converter with 5V bypass. based off of both Tom Whitwell's Stupid USB Power (https://github.com/TomWhitwell/StupidUSBPower) and MMI's USBPower (https://github.com/MMImodular/Modules/tree/master/USBPower)  My ultimate goal was to have a more compact way to power modules than the other two were offering and to learn a few things along the way.  Allegedly this is rated "416mA, capable of 110 ~ 140% overload with automatic recovery once fault condition is removed". This is using the Mean Well DKM10E-12 4.7-9Vin +/-12Vout DC/DC Converter.
